# AVMS
*Automatic Virtual Machine Setup*

A collection of scripts I use to setup my VMs upon creation.

How to use
===

* Clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/TheWill10m/avms.git

* Run the script with root permissions

        source ./path/to/script.sh

Some of these scripts make modifications to the user and will require a re-login of the user to take effect.

        su {$USER}
